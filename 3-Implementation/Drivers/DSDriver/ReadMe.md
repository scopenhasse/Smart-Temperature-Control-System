# DS_Driver

The `DS_Driver` module provides a function `get_ds_temp` to retrieve the temperature value from a DS18B20 temperature sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi.

## Prerequisites

* Raspberry Pi running Raspbian OS
* DS18B20 temperature sensor connected to GPIO pin 4 and ground

## Installation

Enable 1-Wire interface with the raspi-config tool.
`sudo raspi-config`
Select Advanced Option -> 1-Wire -> `<Yes>`

In fact this tool edits the /boot/config.txt and appends this line: dtoverlay=w1-gpio. With this line, a GPIO to drive an external pullup is disabled by default. It's inconvenience in certain condition so we often change "dtoverlay=w1-gpio" to "dtoverlay=w1-gpio-pullup". We also specify GPIO 4 for I/O, so we change the line to "dtoverlay=w1-gpio-pullup,gpiopin=4". Just for instance, because GPIO 4 (BCM numbering, can be checked by this command: gpio readall) is used for I/O by default so "gpiopin=4" is not usually required.

More details about "dtoverlay", please read the manual: /boot/overlays/README.

Finally, we append this line to the config.txt file: "dtoverlay=w1-gpio-pullup,gpiopin=4" (no space in this line).

Check whether the module is started

`lsmod | grep w1`

you should get :
w1_therm               16384  0
w1_gpio                16384  0
wire                   36864  2 w1_gpio,w1_therm

If not, you can start it manually with this command:

`sudo modprobe w1-gpio pullup=1`
`sudo modprobe w1-therm strong_pullup=1`

Read temperature

Change the current directory to /sys/bus/w1/devices and list the directory content:

`cd /sys/bus/w1/devices`

`ls`

You should get a directory named 28-xxxx (xxxx is the serial number of the sensor).
copy the directory name and change the 11th line of the DS_Driver.c file with the directory name :
  `char* path = "/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-072170bed5aa/w1_slave";`

Compile the DS_Driver.c file with the following command:

`gcc -o gettempcode DS_Driver.h DS_Driver.c gettempcode.c`

Run the program with the following command:

`./gettempcode`

You should get the temperature value in Celsius degrees.

## Usage

To use the `get_ds_temp` function in your C code, include the `DS_Driver.h` header file and call the function:

<pre class=""><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>c</span></div></div></pre>

<pre class=""><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-c">#include "DS_Driver.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  float temperature = get_ds_temp();
  printf("The current temperature is %.2fÂ°C\n", temperature);
  return 0;
}
</code></div></div></pre>

## Error Handling

The `get_ds_temp` function may encounter the following errors:

1. File not found error: If the file path specified in the `path` variable does not exist, the `open` function call will fail and return a negative value, which will trigger the `perror` function call to print an error message. The program will then exit with `EXIT_FAILURE` status.
2. Read error: If the `read` function call fails to read from the file, it will return a negative value, which indicates an error. The program will not be able to retrieve the temperature value and may continue executing with an undefined behavior.
3. Memory allocation error: The `temp` buffer might not be large enough to store the temperature string retrieved from the file, leading to a buffer overflow or memory corruption issue.
4. Conversion error: If the temperature string read from the file is not a valid floating-point number, the `atof` function call will return an undefined value, leading to unpredictable behavior.
5. Timing issue: The `sleep` function call may not guarantee an exact amount of time delay, which might affect the accuracy of the temperature reading.
